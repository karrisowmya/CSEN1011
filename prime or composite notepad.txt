ALGORITHM TO FIND WHETHER A NUMBER IS PRIME OR COMPOSITE
1.Start
2.Accept a positive integer 'n'(number greater than 2)
3.Initialise 'counter' with value 2
4.Divide 'n' with the 'counter'
5.If the remainder is 0 display that 'n' is composite and stop the algorithm
6.Else increment the 'counter' and repeat from step 4 until the 'counter' value is less than 'n'
7.After completion of all the steps display that a number 'n' is prime
8.stop
